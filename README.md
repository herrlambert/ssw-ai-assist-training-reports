# Project Description

**Project Title:** Training Reporting Against Legacy Data Model â€“ An AI-Assisted Trial

**Objective:** 
Develop a simple reporting web application using AI assistance, built on the LAMP stack, deployable in a Linux shared-hosting environment. The application will provide reporting against a legacy data model.

**Key Features:**
- **Reporting Capabilities:**
  - Show all trainings and dates for a specific person.
  - Show a list of people who have not taken a specific training within the past 2 years.
- **Security:** Ensure the application is secure and not vulnerable to any items in the OWASP Top 10.
- **Responsive UI:** Provide good usability on mobile devices (tablet and phone) as well as computer monitors.
- **Accessibility:** Meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA accessibility standards.
- **Branding:** Use the current UW brand color palette, keeping digital accessibility in mind.

**AI Assistance Tools:**
- Microsoft Co-Pilot for AI-assisted project definition and work breakdown.
- VS Code with AugmentCode for AI-assisted coding.

**Hosting Environment:** UW Ovid shared hosting environment.

**Data Migration:** Migrate the existing SQL Server data model to MySQL and replace any personally identifiable information (PII) with fake data.
